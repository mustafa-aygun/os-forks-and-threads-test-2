/* Instead of common dining philosophes, we have an additional fork box in this problem.
* Therefore, we should also check that box too. To follow sending 3 signal rule, I create 2 phase
* conditional waiting. First phase is for waiting signal from neighbors, second phase is waiting signal 
* for box. Also we should be aware of the situation that there is two forks on table and no forks in the box.
* At this time, we shouldn't lock the forks on the table. However, because of that, after we get signal for
* the box, we have to check their availablity. Therefore, I implement the following solution:
* 1- Phase is checking neighbors, a philosopher firstly check its right and left neighbors. If they are
* not eating, and he is hungry, he will continue to check box. If one of them is currently eating, he will move
* waiting state from his neighbor on first phase waiting state. 2- Phase: If he can reach the step checking
* box without any problem, he will check the availability of the fork in the box and look neighbors too. 
* If there is no fork, he will 
* move the waiting state  on the box. However, here, the important thing after he get signal for the box, he can
* not directly start to eating. Philosopher has to check neighbor forks again, otherwise if he can continue
* without checking them again, it means he is locking forks on the table which is not allowed. If there is
* again no problem and he can get fork from box too. Then, he will start to eating. After eating, philosopher
* will test their neighbors if they can start to eat, if they can, he will send signal to them. Also, after
* putting fork back to the box, philosopher will signal to box too. Sending signal to box is critical. 
* Let's give an example how can a deadlock may happen if we don't send signal to the box. Let's say there is
* 5 philosopher which are p0-p1-p2-p3-p4 and they can eat max 2 times. We will have 5/3=1 fork in the box. 
* If they are eating in this order, which can be happen with random sleeping time, p3 > p2 > p3 > p2 > p1 >
* p0 > p4 > p0 > p4. All philosopher have eaten 2 times except p1. However, because of p4 is the last one who 
* was eating he can't send signal to p1 with sending right and left neighbors. At this time, sending signal to
* box will solve this deadlock problem. Because p1 is already waiting on the box condition due to his neighbors
* aren't eating. Lastly, let's give an example to way I implemented with 6 philosopher and 2 forks in the box.
* Let's say p0 comes first pass the neighbors test and also box test and started to eating. Then, p1 and p5 comes,
* They will fail neighbors test and will wait on that wait condition. Let's assume 4th one is p2. He will again pass
* neighbors and box test and starting to eating. p3 will fail neighbors test too and will wait on condition.
* And after p4 comes, he won't fail neighbors test however he will fail box test because there is no fork in the
* box. p4 will wait on the box condition. Let's say p2 finishes eating first. He will send signal to p1 and p3
* which are neighbors and box too. After, neighbors get signal they will check first test again, which is 
* neighbors test. p1 will fail it again due to p0 and p3 will pass it. At this time, we should remember p4 will
* also get signal for the box and he will start to check tests again. Both p3 and p4 can pass neighbors test.
* However, only one of them can take the fork from the box because there is only one fork. After one of them will
* get the fork other one will fail box test and also neighbors test too. At this time, philosopher who is faster
* will start to eating. After they finish eating, they will give same signal again and it will continue like that.*/
